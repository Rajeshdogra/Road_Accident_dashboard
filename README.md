 # Road Accident Dashboard in Excel

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The **Road Accident Dashboard** is developed in Excel and visualizes key metrics, trends, and patterns to help better understand accident data. The goal is to extract insights that can inform road safety strategies and potentially reduce the rate and severity of accidents.

## Key Insights
The dashboard includes the following insights and analyses:
- **Primary KPI**: Total casualties resulting from accidents.
- **Casualties by Accident Severity & Vehicle Type**: Understand the distribution of casualties by severity (e.g., fatal, serious) and by different vehicle types.
  
### Secondary Insights
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Breaks down the number of casualties by vehicle type, such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks.
- **Monthly Trend Comparison**: Compares accident trends month-over-month for 2021 and 2022 to identify seasonal or monthly patterns.
- **Road Types with Maximum Casualties**: Identifies which road types (e.g., highways, urban roads) have the highest casualty rates.
- **Casualties by Road Surface Condition**: Analyzes the distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions like wet, dry, or icy.
- **Casualties by Area and Time of Day**: Shows casualty correlation by area type (e.g., urban vs. rural) and time of day (day vs. night) to target specific safety improvements.
